# k8s-workshop
This project contains the exercises material for the kubernetes workshop by Chaima Mansouri. This will help the audience practice the deployment of a k8s application during the workshop. 

## Questions store application 

### Introduction
Questions store is a web application where a user can write their name and the question they have and all the questions will be stored in a central MangoDB deployed in Atlas cloud. 


### Utility 

Questions store is a simple web application that will serve as an exercise for the workshop audience where the user can deploy the application, link it to a database and interact with the 
UI interface. The user is also able to change the application background and text color. 

With that, the user can see the utility of the ConfigMaps, secrets, deployments, Pods, services and Ingress. 

The application will also serve as tool for the audience of the workshop to store their questions, so we can have a cleaner, easier and more organized way of handling the Q&A session at the end of the workshop.
